# hw6-Weatherdashboard-Sajal

## Description
For this assignment I was supposed to create a weather dashboard that could be used for traveling. A user can look at the current weather conditions all over the world or look at the future conditions to plan their trip accordingly.

I created the html, css, and js files and listed all the necessary steps within the js file.

Created html layout of the page.

Added CSS styling to the page.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
