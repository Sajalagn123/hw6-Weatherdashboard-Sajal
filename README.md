# hw6-Weatherdashboard-Sajal

## Description
For this assignment I was supposed to create a weather dashboard that could be used for traveling. A user can look at the current weather conditions all over the world or look at the future conditions to plan their trip accordingly.

I created the html, css, and js files and listed all the necessary steps within the js file.

Created html layout of the page.

Added CSS styling to the page.

Added weather data from the API that shows the current weather, the forecast for 5 days, and icons that correspond to the conditions. Also added fucntional search bar that gives back corresponding data for city searched.

Updated JS file so that the application stores and returns data from local storage and shows up on the side in search history.

Page now loads Los Angeles city data as the default page so it doesn't display no values anymore. The page also has a dynamic uv index that changes color based on the uv scale.

Updated JS file including adding the city name being displayed and made added CSS styling.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
